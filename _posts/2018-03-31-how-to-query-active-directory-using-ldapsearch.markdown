First you need to install the package that provides ldapsearch command:

```
yum install openldap-clients
```

Then run the following command according to your environment:

```
ldapsearch -x -h <active directory server> -D "<user@domain.com>" -W -b \\ 
"CN=<Common Name>,OU=<Organizational Unit>,DC=<Domain Component>,DC=<Domain Component>"
```

* **Common Name:** can be user/group

* **Organizational Unit:** the trees the common name is under. You can also concatenate several OUâ€™s if needed. For example- ```OU=<Organizational Unit 1>,OU=<Organizational Unit 2>```

* **Domain Component:** the domain (DC=domain,DC=com)
